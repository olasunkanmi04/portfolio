I designed and developed my portfolio website using Gridsome.

One important thing I was trying to achieve with building my portfolio was to have a Content Management System (CMS) where I upload projects I have worked on without having to go into my code. And I didn't want something too complex.

I chose to use [Gridsome](https://gridsome.org/), *a Vue.js powered [Jamstack](https://gridsome.org/docs/jamstack) framework for building static generated websites & apps that are [fast by default](https://gridsome.org/docs/fast-by-default/).* It works seamlessly with Netlify CMS, which made it perfect for what I want to achieve.
