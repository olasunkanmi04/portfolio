Granula is a leading survey and rewards platform. Users can launch surveys, analyze data and earn cash & airtime rewards seamlessly from the web or mobile devices.

I worked on the Frontend of Granula platform. Converting UI designs to Progressive Web Application using the component-based approach for reusable design components, while integrating API from the backend team as well as third-party APIs integration such as different payment APIs, google mapâ€™s API, Chatbots, WordPress API etc. I also set up Granula [blog](https://news.granula.ai/) using WordPress, hosting it separately from the main application with features such as Polling.

## Survey Form Builder

I built a Survey Form Builder for research clients to create questionnaires with different form elements question types such as:

* Single choice
* Multiple choice
* Email
* Phone number
* Image
* Location
* Time
* Date
* Likert Scale
* Signature
* e.t.c

I break the form builder into components and communicated across components using Props and Events. Users can select a question type, and fill title, description, keyword, etc. of the question and save it.
